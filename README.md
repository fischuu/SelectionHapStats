SelectionHapStats is a GitHub repository of Python scripts to identify and visualize genomic loci under natural selection using the statistics H12, H2/H1, G12, G123, and G2/G1. This work is described in the README document README_selectionHapStats.pdf and in greater detail in the following papers: 

H12 and H2/H1 statistics:

Garud NR, Messer P, Buzbas E, and Petrov D. “Soft selective sweeps are the primary mode of adaptation in Drosophila.” PLoS Genetics 11: e1005004 (2015). 

Garud NR and Petrov DA. “Elevated linkage disequilibrium and signatures of soft sweeps are common in Drosophila melanogaster.” Genetics (2016).
